    /* TODO: Problem 10: In our game, we want our enemy to alternate weapons every couple of frames.
    However, also would like our enemy to lose access to their weapons when they are frozen/disabled.
    First, let's define a public class named Weapon. In the class, define 3 int variables for arrow, sword, and rocket.
    

    Outside of our Weapon class, we would want to define an IEnumerator function. 
    Then in our class, write a for loop that loops between the arrow, sword, and rocket. 
    Use the WaitForSeconds function to tell it to switch weapons every 5 seconds. 

    Remember to call your Coroutine.
